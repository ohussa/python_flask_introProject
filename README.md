# python_flask_introProject
#### Introduction
I did this project to test the web framework and the concept of dynamic website.

The concept is of RPG games. So the user is a character from ancient chinese monarchy.
Everytime the user opens the website, a new character is shown on the website. 
("welcome home <ins>general</ins>/<ins>philospopher</ins>/<ins>emperor</ins>/<ins>healer</ins>")

1. Run the python file
2. A link will appear in the console, copy the link that is displayed. Open the link in your browser
